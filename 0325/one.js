/* A school’s lockers are numbered 1 to 100. One hundred students
enter the school one at a time. The first student opens the lockers.
The second student closes the even numbered lockers. The third
student either closes or opens every third locker. The remaining
students continue the pattern. Write a program to determine
which lockers remain open at the end, after the last one of the
students passes. Explain the result. Make sure the program not
only reports the situation at the end but also conveys the stages
through which the array of lockers passes. */
